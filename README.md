# Libft - Custom C Library

## Overview

Libft is a project focused on creating a custom C library. It includes re-implementations of standard libc functions along with additional utilities. These are crucial for building robust C programs.

## Purpose

The goal is to deepen understanding of standard functions by re-implementing them. This library serves as a foundation for future projects, ensuring students have the tools they need.

## Build Instructions

The library compiles with `-Wall`, `-Wextra`, and `-Werror` flags using a Makefile. To compile, run:

```bash
make all
```
## Usage

Include `libft.h` in your C projects to utilize the library's functions.

## Implemented Functions

### Core Functions
- Mimics libc functions such as `ft_strlen` and `ft_memcpy`. These adhere to the original prototypes and behaviors.

### Additional Functions
- Includes extended functionality like linked list operations. Activate these with:

```bash
make bonus
```
